# 🏆 **2. HOW TO WIN HACKATHONS (Beginner → Winner Blueprint)**

## ⭐ Mindset:  
> **Apply to every hackathon you find — quantity builds quality.**

---

## 🧩 **Hackathon Winning Strategy**

### 🔧 **Use Predefined Templates**  
- Create your own frontend templates for:  
  - Login page  
  - Signup page  
  - Dashboard  
- Reuse them in every hackathon to save hours.

### 🧠 **Learning With Building**  
Every hackathon = a mini project.  
You learn while you build → fastest way to grow.

### ⚡ **Tools to Build MVP Fast**  
Use these for instant UI/UX + prototypes:  
- Cursor AI  
- Loveable  
- v0.dev  
- MakeMyApp  
- Bolt  
- (or any no-code MVP tool)

### 💡 **Hack for Productivity**  
- Use GitHub to explore ideas  
- Fork → Remix → Rename → Make it unique  
- Follow the rule: **"Jo Dikhta Hai Vo Bikta Hai"**  
  - Simple, beautiful UI > Overcomplicated backend

### 🧪 **Submission Strategy**  
- Record a short demo video  
- Add clear README + screenshots  
- Prepare a 60-second pitch  
- Keep UI clean, colors consistent  
- Final presentation matters A LOT
