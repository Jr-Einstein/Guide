## ✅ Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- A **Google account** with access to **Gemini 3**.  
- Access to the **Deep Research** feature (via eligible plan/region).  
- Past **5 years of university exam question papers** for a **single subject**:
  - Preferably in **PDF** or clear image formats.

.
├── papers/
│   ├── 2020_SubjectName.pdf
│   ├── 2021_SubjectName.pdf
│   ├── 2022_SubjectName.pdf
│   ├── 2023_SubjectName.pdf
│   └── 2024_SubjectName.pdf
└── README.md

## 1️⃣ Step 1 – Go to Gemini

1. Open your browser and go to **[https://gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com)**.
2. Sign in with your **Google account**.
3. Confirm that you see **Gemini 3** available on the interface.

At this point you have access to the AI model that will analyze your past question papers.

---

## 2️⃣ Step 2 – Use the Deep Research Tool

1. In Gemini, click to start a **new chat**.
2. Look for the option labeled **Deep Research** (this may appear as a toggle, button, or within a “Tools” / “Research” menu).
3. Turn **Deep Research** ON so Gemini can:

   * Read your uploaded documents in detail.
   * Perform multi-step analysis on the content.

Deep Research is essential here because it allows Gemini to thoroughly read all papers and perform a proper trend analysis instead of just answering a simple question.

---

## 3️⃣ Step 3 – Upload Past 5 Years’ Papers to Match Repetitive Topics

1. In the same Deep Research chat, use the option such as **Attach files**, **Upload files**, or **Add sources**.
2. Upload all the exam question papers (for the **same subject**) from the last **5 years**.
3. Verify:

   * You have included each year you want Gemini to analyze.
   * The files are clearly readable (no extreme blur, missing pages, or heavy cropping).

By uploading these papers, you give Gemini the full history it needs to:

* See which topics appear **again and again**.
* Measure how often each chapter or concept shows up.

This is the foundation for identifying **repetitive and high-weightage topics**.

---

## 4️⃣ Step 4 – Enter This Prompt

After your files are uploaded and Deep Research is enabled, paste this prompt into the Gemini chat:

```text
You are an expert educational data analyst.

Analyze all uploaded past question papers for this subject. Read every question carefully, categorize them by chapter/topic, and group similar questions together.

Perform a detailed trend analysis and identify the most frequently repeated and high-weightage topics asked across the past years. Do not ask any follow-up questions. Directly provide:

1. A clean list of important topics.
2. Topic-wise frequency (years repeated).
3. Marks distribution patterns.
4. Recurring question styles.
5. A short explanation for why each topic is high priority.

Focus only on analyzing the uploaded papers. Do not generate future questions. Present the output in a clear table + bullet points.
```

This prompt tells Gemini to:

* Analyze **all uploaded past question papers**.
* **Do a trend analysis** and **identify the important topics** on which most questions are asked every year.
* **Not ask any follow-up questions**.
* **Just list the topics with analysis**, including frequency and importance.

If you want a shorter backup version, you can also keep this variant:

```text
Analyze all the uploaded past question papers, perform a trend analysis, and identify the most frequently repeated and high-weightage topics for every year. Do not ask any follow-up questions. Just list the important topics with your analysis of their frequency, marks weightage, and recurring patterns.
```

---

## 5️⃣ Step 5 – Get the Trend Analysis

Once you send the prompt, Gemini 3 with Deep Research will:

1. Read each uploaded paper and break down every question.
2. Group questions into **topics/chapters** (e.g., “Linked Lists”, “Complex Integration”, “OS Scheduling Algorithms”).
3. Count how many times each topic has appeared across the last 5 years.
4. Estimate **marks distribution** by topic, based on the question marks in each paper.
5. Identify:

   * **Frequently repeated topics** – asked almost every year.
   * **Medium-frequency topics** – appear on some papers.
   * **Rare topics** – appear rarely or only once.

The response you receive should typically include:

* A **list or table of topics**, years asked, and approximate total marks.
* A written **analysis explaining which topics are most important** and why.
* Notes on **recurring question patterns** (theory, numericals, derivations, proofs, etc.).

This is your **trend analysis**, created from the past 5 years of actual question papers.

---

## 6️⃣ Step 6 – Study Only the Important Topics

Use the trend analysis to plan **focused revision** instead of trying to study everything equally.

### 🎯 6.1 Build Priority Tiers

From Gemini’s output, divide your topics into three tiers:

* **Tier 1 – High Priority (Core Topics)**

  * Asked in **most or all** of the 5 years.
  * Usually carry **high marks** and appear as long-answer or complex questions.
  * These topics likely cover a large portion of your exam marks.

* **Tier 2 – Medium Priority**

  * Asked in **some years**, with moderate marks weightage.
  * Important but not as dominant as Tier 1.

* **Tier 3 – Low Priority**

  * Rarely asked topics.
  * Minimal contribution to overall marks.

### 📚 6.2 How to Study Using the Tiers

* **Tier 1 (High Priority)**

  * Study these topics **in depth** from your textbook, notes, and other resources.
  * Cover theory, formulas, derivations, proofs, and typical numericals.
  * Practice as many past questions as possible for each topic.

* **Tier 2 (Medium Priority)**

  * Ensure you understand main concepts and key formulas.
  * Practice a few representative questions for each topic (1–3 is often enough).
  * Aim to be comfortable, even if not perfect, in these areas.

* **Tier 3 (Low Priority)**

  * Skim through them if you have time after finishing Tier 1 and Tier 2.
  * Learn the basic idea of each topic so you are not completely blank, but do not overspend time here.

### 🗓️ 6.3 Optional – Ask Gemini for a Study Schedule

You can use Gemini again to turn the trend analysis into a **day-by-day schedule**. For example:

```text
Using the high-, medium-, and low-priority topics that you identified from my uploaded papers, create a 10-day study schedule for me. Assume I can study 3 hours per day. Give more time to high-priority topics, then medium, and the least time to low-priority topics. Provide clear daily goals as bullet points.
```

This converts the trend analysis into a concrete **action plan**.

## 7️⃣ Step 7 – Score 90+ Marks (Smart, Data-Driven Preparation)

The final goal is to use this entire process to **maximize your score** by studying in a smart, data-driven way.

### 🧠 7.1 How This Helps You Aim for 90+

* You concentrate on **topics that historically carry the most marks**.
* You reduce wasted effort on topics that appear infrequently.
* You understand **examiner patterns**, not just the syllabus.
* You practice questions that are **similar in style** to what usually appears.

### 🏆 7.2 Best Practices for High Scores

To realistically aim for **90+ marks**:

1. **Master Tier 1 topics** completely – no weak chapter in this group.
2. **Revise Tier 2 topics** thoroughly – you should be comfortable solving exam-level questions.
3. Use Tier 3 as **extra coverage** only after finishing Tier 1 and Tier 2.
4. Ask Gemini to:

   * Generate **practice questions** similar to past papers.
   * Check your written answers for **clarity, completeness, and correctness**.
   * Explain any concept you are still confused about, in simple steps.

Example practice prompt:

```text
From the high-priority topics you identified, generate 10 practice questions that are similar in style and difficulty to my university exam papers. After I write the answers and paste them here, check them, give corrections, and mark each out of full marks.
```

By combining:

* Trend analysis from past papers, and
* Deep understanding + practice on key topics,

you are giving yourself a strong chance to reach **very high marks**, provided you also manage your time and exam strategy well.
